Salon Haircut Website with MERN Stack (Future AI Integration)
Project Overview
You're building a salon service booking website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with plans to add AI features later. Here's how to structure your project for both current needs and future AI integration.

How the Project Works
Frontend (React) Flow
User Visits Website: Starts at Home page

Navigation: User can browse through:

About Us (company information)

Services (list of salon services with prices)

Contact Us (contact form)

Login/Signup (authentication)

Book Appointment (main feature)

Booking Process:

User selects services (haircut type, facial, massage, etc.)

System shows total price and estimated wait time

User pays ₹5 booking fee (non-refundable)

System shows nearby salons sorted by distance

User selects preferred salon and time slot

Booking confirmation displayed

Backend (Node.js/Express) Flow
API Endpoints:

/api/auth - Handles login/signup

/api/services - Gets list of services

/api/salons - Gets salon data

/api/bookings - Handles bookings

/api/payments - Processes payments

Database (MongoDB) Schemas:

User - Stores customer data

Salon - Stores salon information (location, services, etc.)

Service - Different salon services

Booking - Appointment details

Payment - Payment records

Authentication:

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login

Password encryption

Future AI Integration
When you're ready to add AI features:

AI Model Location:

The main AI logic will reside in the /ai directory

Can use pre-trained models or build custom ones

AI Features to Add:

Salon recommendation system (distance, price, wait time, ratings)

Wait time prediction based on current bookings

Optimal salon sorting algorithm

AI Data Flow:

Frontend sends user preferences/location to backend

Backend processes this data through AI service

AI analyzes salons based on multiple factors

Returns sorted list of best options

Possible AI Models:

Recommendation systems (collaborative filtering)

Regression models for wait time prediction

Simple rule-based systems initially

Key Connections Between Parts
Frontend-Backend:

React makes API calls to Express server using Axios/Fetch

Express processes requests and returns JSON responses

Backend-Database:

Mongoose ODM connects Express to MongoDB

Models define data structure and validation

Future AI Integration:

Express routes will call AI services when needed

AI services will process data and return enhanced results

Results flow back through same API structure

Important Files to Understand
Frontend:

App.js - Main router for all pages

services/api.js - Handles all API calls

contexts/AuthContext.js - Manages user authentication state

Backend:

server.js - Starts the server

app.js - Configures Express middleware/routes

models/* - Define your database schemas

routes/* - Define your API endpoints

Database:

Connection is established in config/db.js

Models define how data is stored/retrieved

Development Approach
First Build Core Features:

Basic website with pages

Booking system without AI

Simple salon listing sorted by distance

Then Add AI Later:

Create AI service that takes current salon list

Enhances sorting with additional factors

Plug this into existing API endpoints

Keep AI Separate Initially:

Build so core functionality works without AI

AI becomes an enhancement layer

This makes it easier to add/change later

Tips for Future AI Integration
Design Flexible APIs:

Make your current endpoints return raw data

Later you can add AI processing middleware

Collect Relevant Data Now:

Store salon ratings, wait times, locations

This data will train your AI models later

Keep AI Logic Separate:

Isolate AI code in its own directory

Makes it easier to update/replace models
